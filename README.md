# My Curated n8n Explorations

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on experiments and discoveries made while working with n8n. Each exploration highlights a specific idea, integration.

## Repository Structure

Each exploration is organized into its own folder and contains:

- **workflow.json**  
  The exported n8n workflow for that specific case.

- **README.md**  
  A short explanation of the scenario, what was tested, how it works, and key insights from the exploration.

This structure keeps every case self-contained and easy to revisit or reference.

## Purpose

The aim of this repository is to present a curated set of n8n explorations in a clear and organized format. It serves as a personal reference and a place to document experiments that might be useful.
